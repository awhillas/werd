# About Us

These are take from [37 Signals manifesto](https://37signals.com/00/). These are the ideas that resonate with us:

## An obligation to independence

We have no investors, no board of directors, no eyes on an exit. We feel a moral obligation to exercise our independence. To do things no one would give us permission to do. To try things other companies would be afraid to try. To skip safe, and go for original.

## Small teams

You can do big things with small teams, but it’s hard to do small things with big teams. And small is often plenty. That’s the power of small — you do what needs to be done rather than overdoing it.

## Make more than you spend!

The tech industry is especially good at losing money. Growth is electric, but profits are elusive. We take an old school, economics 101 approach: Make more than you spend. That’s why we’ve been profitable every year we’ve been in business. It’s the responsible way to be reliable and take care of customers over the long haul.

## We don’t sell you

They say that if you don’t pay for what you use, then you’re the one that’s for sale. Not here. We don’t sell customer data to anyone, and we don’t use personal information to place targeted advertising either. We make a product, people pay for that product, end of transaction. Our business model is selling products, not selling you.

## The Fortune 5,000,000

Companies are obsessed with battling for huge Fortune 500 customers. That’s boring. We’re more interested in the Fortune 5,000,000 — small and mid-sized companies just like us. They’re underserved, they’re ignored, and they don’t get the respect they deserve. We’re here for them.
